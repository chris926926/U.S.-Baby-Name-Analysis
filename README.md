# U.S.-Baby-Name-Analysis

This project used Python Pandas and Numpy to collect all baby names in U.S. since 1880, analyzed last letter frequency of the name in gender, then aggregated data in decades and evaluated the name popularities in a statistic way. Finally, I used matplotlib to visualize the result, demonstrated the impacts of demographic facts on the name popularities.
